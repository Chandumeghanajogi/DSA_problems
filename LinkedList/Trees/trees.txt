Binary Trees:

the trees that have atmost 2 children .
The maximum number of the nodes at the each level is the 2^levelnumber
The Traversals in the trees:
--- BFS
---DFS-------->the inorder,the preorder,the postorder..


BREADTH FIRST SEARCH:
-->it is also known as the level order traversal
--->traverses the tree level by level only.
eg :
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

In the inoreder traversal we go to left--root--right  even we goto the left them too left ---root---right  if we go to right side also then too left--root--right only..

The preOrder:

root---left--right

The PostOrder:

left--right--root
